# Sec3_Group14_Project
The developers for this project are Brian Egona, Joel Paul Fernandez and Micheal Olanipekun
This README was written mainly because of the way the Module 2 was merged to the main.
There was an issue with the original Module2 branch and this made merging it to the main an issue, so a new branch called Module2_V2 was created
This module contains comments of the person that developed each function at the top of the functions file for the professors reference
We hope our project is clear enough for you!
